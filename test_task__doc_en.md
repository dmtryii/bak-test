# Application-Site Development Plan

## 1. General Concept Description
The goal is to create a universal web application that provides:
- **Data Management**: Uploading, editing, and processing tables (Excel-like functionality).
- **Business Features**: Integration with 1C for automated accounting and warehouse management.
- **Calculators**: Customizable calculators for specific user needs.
- **Bots**: Integration with a Telegram bot for quick data access and notifications.
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Integration with ChatGPT for text generation, data analysis, and task automation.

## 2. Application Architecture

### **Frontend**
- **Technologies**: React.js, Material-UI for a modern user interface.
- **Features**:
  - Interface for table management (uploading, editing, sorting).
  - Calculator modules with interactive fields.
  - Panel for bot and ChatGPT integration.

### **Backend**
- **Technologies**: Python (Flask/Django) or Java (Spring Boot).
- **Features**:
  - APIs for handling tables, calculators, and integration with 1C.
  - Integration with OpenAI API for ChatGPT.
  - Authorization system using JWT or OAuth2.

### **Database**
- **PostgreSQL**: For storing user data, tables, and logs.
- **Redis**: For caching to enable faster data access.

### **Integrations**
1. **Excel**: Import/export `.xlsx` files using Pandas or Apache POI.
2. **1C**: Integration via API or JSON/XML file exchange.
3. **Telegram Bot**: Communication with users via Aiogram library.
4. **OpenAI ChatGPT**: Integration via API for text generation and data analysis.

### **Hosting**
- **Docker**: Component containerization.
- **NGINX**: Load balancing.
- **VPS (DigitalOcean/AWS)**: Application hosting.
- **Cloudflare**: Use of CDN for faster content delivery and WAF for cybersecurity.

---

## 3. Component Interaction
- **User** works via a web interface: edits tables, creates calculations, and queries ChatGPT.
- **Application** stores tables in a database or synchronizes them with 1C.
- **Bot** sends notifications about important events (e.g., table processing completion) or responds to user queries.
- **AI (ChatGPT)** helps analyze tables, generate documents, and explain data.
